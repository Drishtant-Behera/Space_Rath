# SPACE RATH
I have envisioned this is going to be an top-down shooter using pygame and only language which is going to be used is python this game is meant for me to learn more about python so the game isn't going to look like the games made by game developers in big companies this game is being made for my own pleasure if you want to use my code you are free to it can be used as a template for something maybe you want to try out


## Files
For now if you want to find code go to the file and for sprites same thing
